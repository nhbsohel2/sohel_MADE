# Project Plan

## Title

 Economic Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture

## Main Question


Assess how climate change is affecting agricultural productivity and the economy.

## Description


Climate change poses a significant threat to global agriculture, affecting crop yields and economic stability. This project aims to analyze the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity by examining the relationship between climate variables and crop yields over time. Using datasets from the European Data Portal and GovData, we will correlate changes in temperature and precipitation with agricultural output. The results will provide insights into the economic consequences of climate variability and inform strategies for mitigating adverse effects on agriculture.

## Datasources

### Datasource1:
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets?locale=en
* Data URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tag00047/default/table?lang=en
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains detailed statistics on crop production across various European countries. It includes data on different types of crops, their yields, and production areas.

### Datasource2:
* Metadata URL: https://www.govdata.de/web/guest/suchen/-/details/climate-data-germany
* Data URL: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/monthly/kl/historical/
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides historical climate data for Germany, including temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related variables. It offers a comprehensive view of climatic conditions over time.
