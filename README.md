# Climate Change and Agricultural Production in Europe

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between temperature changes and agricultural production in European countries. By analyzing historical data on temperature and food production, we aim to understand how rising temperatures might be affecting agricultural output. The analysis uses data from FAOSTAT for temperature changes and the Kaggle dataset "Global Food and Agriculture Statistics" for food production values.

## Objectives

- To analyze the impact of temperature changes on agricultural production in European countries.
- To identify patterns and correlations between temperature change and food production.
- To provide insights and recommendations for policymakers and agricultural practitioners.

## Data Sources

- **Temperature Change Data:** FAOSTAT (1961-2022)
- **Food Production Data:** Kaggle dataset "Global Food and Agriculture Statistics"

## Methodology

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured data consistency and accuracy by removing irrelevant columns and filtering for European countries.
- Normalization: Normalized temperature change and food production values for comparison.
- Visualization: Used grouped bar charts, scatter plot matrices, and heatmaps to visualize data and identify patterns.

## Key Findings

- The relationship between temperature change and food production is not straightforward and is influenced by various factors.
- Some countries with significant temperature changes also show high food production, but this pattern is not consistent across all countries.
- Other factors such as soil quality, irrigation practices, and economic conditions also play a significant role in agricultural production.

## Conclusion

While there is some correlation between temperature changes and food production, it is not the sole determinant. A multifaceted approach is needed to fully understand and address the impacts of climate change on agriculture. Future research should incorporate additional variables, use advanced statistical models, and conduct detailed case studies.
